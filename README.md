🚀 Hi there, I’m David Arinze

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a Backend Engineer passionate about designing scalable systems, building clean and efficient APIs, and delivering production-ready solutions that balance performance with maintainability.

🧠 Core Focus: Backend architecture, microservices, and real-time systems.

🛠️ Tech Stack: Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes.

⚙️ Tools & Practices: CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), containerized deployments, and observability with Grafana + Prometheus.
